# DDS6306_Project2
Wine Quality Project for Final
Prvided in this repositories is all code, plots, Rshiny code, slides and Rshiny dashboard used to generate this project. I still have issues with publishing my rShiny dashboard, however, the code runs and will generate the dashboard but I am unable to publish the dasboard to rShiny.
Provided is a link to my Youtube video presentation: https://youtu.be/7zxV1GTyewU
Note: There are 2 Rshiny html files provided. I included my initial attempt of a Rshiny dashboard(Wine_Quality_Shiny) and then made some updates to the code to allow the dashboard (Wine Quality Dashboard) to be able to generate plots from a given data set.
